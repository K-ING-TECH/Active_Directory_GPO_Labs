Password_GPO

This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a Group Policy Object (GPO) for enforcing password complexity requirements in Active Directory, along with best practices recommended by security experts.
Step-by-Step Guide to Enforce Password Complexity via GPO
1. Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

    On your domain controller, press Win + R, type gpmc.msc, and press Enter.

2. Navigate to the Default Domain Policy

    In the left pane of the GPMC, expand your domain. The path would typically be Forest -> Domains -> YourDomain.
    Right-click on "Default Domain Policy" and select "Edit." This will open the Group Policy Management Editor.

3. Edit the Password Policy

    In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy.

4. Configure Password Complexity Requirements

    Double-click on "Password must meet complexity requirements."
    Set the policy to "Enabled." Click "OK."
    Complexity requirements typically include:
        Passwords must be at least six characters long.
        Passwords cannot contain the user’s account name or parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters.
        Passwords must contain characters from three of the following four categories:
            Uppercase letters (A-Z)
            Lowercase letters (a-z)
            Digits (0-9)
            Special characters (e.g., !, $, #, %)

5. Configure Additional Password Policies

    Security professionals recommend configuring the following additional policies to enhance security:
        Minimum password length: Set to at least 12 characters to enhance security.
        Maximum password age: Set to 90 days to ensure regular password updates.
        Minimum password age: Set to 1 day to prevent users from cycling through passwords too quickly.
        Enforce password history: Set to remember at least 24 previous passwords to prevent reuse.

6. Implement Account Lockout Policies

    Additionally, configure account lockout policies to protect against brute-force attacks:
        Account lockout threshold: Set to 5 invalid logon attempts.
        Account lockout duration: Set to 30 minutes.
        Reset account lockout counter after: Set to 30 minutes.

7. Close the Editor

    Close the Group Policy Management Editor. The changes are automatically saved.

8. Force Group Policy Update (Optional)

    To apply the changes immediately, you can force an update on the target machines by running gpupdate /force in the command prompt.

Best Practices

    Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of password policies and compliance to ensure adherence to security standards.
    User Education: Educate users about creating strong passwords and the importance of not sharing them.
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an additional layer of security beyond just passwords.
    Use of Password Managers: Encourage the use of password managers to help users manage complex passwords securely.
