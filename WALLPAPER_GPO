WALLPAPER_GPO

This project provides a detailed guide on how to set up a Group Policy Object (GPO) to enforce a desktop wallpaper for users in a specific Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory. 
The wallpaper file is stored on the domain controller (DC) and shared with users.
Step-by-Step Guide to Set a Desktop Wallpaper via GPO

1. Storing the Wallpaper on the Domain Controller
Upload the Wallpaper File to the Domain Controller

    Copy the wallpaper image file to a directory on the domain controller. For example, you could place it in a folder called C:\Wallpapers.

Share the Folder

    Share the folder containing the wallpaper so that all users have read access.
        Right-click the folder (C:\Wallpapers), select "Properties," then go to the "Sharing" tab.
        Click "Share," add "Authenticated Users" or a similar group, and set the permission level to "Read." Click "Share" and then "Done."

2. Setting the GPO to Use the Wallpaper
Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

    On your domain controller, open the Group Policy Management Console by pressing Win + R, typing gpmc.msc, and pressing Enter.

Navigate to the Sales OU

    In the left pane of the GPMC, navigate to the Sales OU where you want to create and link the GPO.

Create a New GPO

    Right-click on the Sales OU and select "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here..."
    Name the GPO something like "Sales Wallpaper GPO" and click "OK."

Edit the GPO

    Right-click on the newly created GPO and select "Edit" to open the Group Policy Management Editor.

Configure Wallpaper Settings

    In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to User Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Desktop -> Desktop.
    Double-click on the "Desktop Wallpaper" setting.

Set the Wallpaper

    In the "Desktop Wallpaper" window, set the following options:
        Wallpaper Name: Enter the full UNC path to the wallpaper image file. For example, \\DCName\Wallpapers\wallpaper.jpg (replace DCName with the actual name of your domain controller).
        Wallpaper Style: Select the appropriate style (e.g., Fill, Fit, Stretch, Tile, Center). For example, select "Fill."
    Click "Enabled" to enforce the setting, then click "OK."

Close the Editor

    Close the Group Policy Management Editor. The changes are automatically saved.

Link the GPO to the Sales OU

    Ensure the GPO is linked to the Sales OU where it should be applied.

3. Force Group Policy Update (Optional)

    To apply the changes immediately, you can force an update on the target machines by running gpupdate /force in the command prompt.

4. Verify and Troubleshoot
Verify

    Log on to a user account within the Sales OU and check if the wallpaper has been applied.

Troubleshoot

    If the wallpaper is not applied, verify the network path to the wallpaper, ensure the users have read access to the shared folder, and check for any conflicting policies.

By following these steps, you can store the wallpaper on the domain controller and ensure that it is applied to all users in the Sales OU via GPO. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!


Best Practices:

    Consistent Naming: Ensure all shared resources follow a consistent naming convention for easy identification.
    Permissions Management: Regularly review and update the shared folder permissions to maintain security.
    User Education: Inform users about the new policy and how it will affect their desktop environment.
    Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation of all GPO settings and changes for future reference.
